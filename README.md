# TensorFlow-DeepLearning-Templates
Standard Tensorflow templates, taken from the Deep Learning specialization course on coursera.
These are in the form of jupyter notebooks. There is no point in running them as there are external dependencies in each file. However, they act as good templates to get started with the general flow of a standard tensorflow project.
